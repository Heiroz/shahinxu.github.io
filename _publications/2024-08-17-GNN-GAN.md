This paper introduces an innovative use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic packet-level header traces. By leveraging the structure of GNNs and the generative capability of GANs, our approach achieves high accuracy and preserves statistical properties of real network data.
