collection: publications

permalink: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07495
excerpt: 'We propose LLM-Sketch, based on the insight that fields beyond the flow IDs in packet headers can also help infer flow sizes. By using a two-tier data structure and separately recording large and small flows, LLM-Sketch improves accuracy while minimizing memory usage.'
