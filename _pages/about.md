I am **Zhen Xu**, a senior undergraduate student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. My research interests span **Intelligent Data Plane**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Machine Learning Systems**. I am particularly focused on:

- **Making Large Language Models More Efficient**
  - Model compression and optimization
  - Efficient inference architecture design
  
- **Advancing Graph Generative Models**
  - Scalable graph generation
  - Applications in network simulation

### Previous Focus

**Integration of AI and Networking**: Exploring in-network AI deployment on programmable data planes (e.g., Tofino). Successfully implemented neural networks directly on switches for **stream counting problems**, achieving better performance than traditional sketch-based methods.

**Traffic Generation**: Developed generative models to synthesize realistic network traffic patterns, addressing the challenges of limited public datasets and privacy concerns in networking research. The approach enables generation of both time-series and tabular network data.
