I am **Zhen Xu**, a senior undergraduate student at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Intelligent Data Plane** and **LLMs**. I am currently seeking research opportunities in the following areas:

- **Intelligent Data Plane**
- **AI4Networking**
- **Generative Model**

### Research Focus

I am particularly passionate about the **integration of AI and networking**, and my work explores how advanced AI techniques like **deep learning** and **reinforcement learning** can be applied to optimize traditional networking tasks. The traditional approach is to separate the model from the network device. On smart switches (e.g., tofino) network tasks are typically performed in the data plane, while the model is deployed on remote servers, which limits further applications of the model. I work on deploying a variety of learning models and even more complex neural networks on the intelligent data plane to solve a variety of problems. I have found that this approach has been shown to have advantages in solving **stream counting problem**, compared to traditional **Sketch** methods.

I am very interested in **generative modeling**. Good quality datasets are indispensable in network research. However, for most researchers, public traffic is very scarce and user privacy is carried in this traffic. To make matters worse, quality datasets like **CAIDA** are closed to some regions and countries. I hope that generative models can learn to characterize traffic in limited datasets and thus alleviate this situation. This model can also provide methods for the generation of time series or other tabular data.
