## Projects

### Machine Learning for Sketch  
**Instructed by Prof. Tong Yang, Peking University (2024.07 - present)**  
- Developed code for data processing and model training to classify network traffic.
- Optimized models for more accurate measurements in sketch systems.  
- Conducted CPU and P4 experiments to validate the application of ML in traffic classification.

### Network Traffic Synthesis
**Instructed by Prof. Tong Yang, Peking University (2024.05 - present)**  
- Designed a framework using a sparse diffusion model to generate metadata for network traces.  
- Reduced memory overhead by converting adjacency matrices into edge lists.  
- Benchmarked performance against baseline models (NetShare, NetDiffusion).  

### Network Traffic Synthesis (Self-directed)  
**2024.06 - 2024.08**  
- Proposed a novel approach integrating GNN features to enhance GAN-based models.  
- Extracted hidden variables to represent field relationships for better trace generation.  
- Authored and completed a related paper.  

### Retrieval Augmented Generation for Mining Industry  
**Collaboration with Kaiwu Team (2024.05 - present)**  
- Deployed the RAG system, ensuring smooth integration with existing infrastructure.  
- Optimized vector databases for improved retrieval efficiency.  
- Developed a predictive model for estimating mining site value based on multiple variables.  

### Multi-modal Data Evaluation  
**Instructed by Prof. Gongsheng Yuan, Zhejiang University (2023.12 - 2024.06)**  
- Defined key evaluation methodologies for multi-modal data.  
- Reviewed and analyzed literature on "single-modal" and multi-modal evaluation.  
- Developed a framework addressing complexities in multi-modal data.
